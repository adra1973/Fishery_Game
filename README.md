Program developed for calculation of a Nash Equilibrium in a Stochastic Dynamic Game

## Remark:

This program is considered in the numerical section of the article: *Empirical approximation of Nash equilibria in finite Markov games with discounted payoffs*, whose authors are Alan D. Robles-Aguilar, David González-Sánchez and J. Adolfo Minjárez-Sosa (2020)

### Description:

Details about the underlying stochastic game can be found in the mentioned article.

This program considers a game among to companies dedicated to capture fish resources in a certain region.

in order to simplifly the calculations, the actions for both players are the same and thus we have a symmetrical game where the solution is the same for both players.

The Nash Equilibria are calculated with a procedure using the McKelvey formula to get a function where the minimum points of this function correspond to the Nash Equilibrium.

The results of the program are located in a text file by rows with the number of the stage, the pure strategies and the value of the game for each state.

To run the program, copy the code run it and that is.

You can change some variables and specifications like number of iterations for empiric distribution, number of stages of projection, 
probability of Binomial distribution, discount factor, etc.

we have added comments in every part of the program in order to facilitate its handling.

In case of doubts, questions, suggestions or comments, you can contact to one of its authors: Alan Robles at this e-mail adress: alan_daniel@yahoo.com

Thank you.
